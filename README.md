# Cucumber Basics

**Skill Level:** Beginner  
**Time Limit:** 30 minutes

Write a feature test in Gherkin and implement `steps_definitions` that best match the intended behaviours and features requested by the 'client'

- The client is a Classy Hotel that caters to animals
- They have created a script to track their clientele
- The hotel manager wants the script to keep track of the name, type and age of every animal
- Test the `Animal` object and ensure that it has the right output for its reader methods `name, type, age, old?`
