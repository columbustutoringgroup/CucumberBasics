# Cucumber Basics

__Skill Level:__ Beginner  
__Time Limit:__ 30 minutes

Write a feature test in Gherkin and implement `steps_definitions` that best match the intended behaviours and features requested by the 'client'

- The client is a Classy Hotel that caters to animals
- They have created a script to track their clientele
- The hotel manager wants the script to keep track of the name, type and age of every animal
- Test the `Animal` object and ensure that it has the right output for its reader methods `name, type, age, old?`

## Instructions
- Checkout the sample feature & steps defs named `greeter.feature` & `greeter_steps.rb`
- `clone` your repo on to your computer
- `cd` into your directory
- `bundle` to pull in this project's dependencies
- navigate to `features/animal.feature` and write your feature
- navigate to `features/step_definitions/animal_steps.rb` and write your step defs
